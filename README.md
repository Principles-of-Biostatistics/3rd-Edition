# Principles of Biostatistics, 3rd Edition

### Welcome to the Principles of Biostatistics 3rd edition companion repository!

This repository contains the datasets and Stata and R code used for the Further Applications examples for each chapter, as well as the datasets used in the Review Exercises throughout the book.

Folder details:
* __Data for Main Text__: contains data files needed for most tables and figures throughout the book. Each data file is a Stata data file (`.dta`). There is also a spreadsheet with details about each data file, and which chapter(s) use the dataset. Note that data files were created using Stata version 16 and may not open for older versions of Stata.

* __Data for Review Exercises__: contains all data files needed for the Review Exercises throughout the book. Each data file is a Stata data file (`.dta`). There is also a spreadsheet with details about each data file, and which chapter(s) use the dataset. Note that data files were created using Stata version 16 and may not open for older versions of Stata.

* __Files for Further Applications__: contains all data files (`.dta` files) and code needed for the Further Applications sections throughout the book. Data files are available in the `Data for Further Applications` folder, R code is available in the `R Code` folder, and Stata code is available in the `Stata Code` folder. Note that data files were created using Stata version 16 and may not open for older versions of Stata.

* __Solutions Manual__: The solutions to exercises from chapter 1-3 have been posted. We are continuously working on the solutions manual and will update the solutions pdf file as we complete the exercises for each chapter. The solutions manual for the 2nd edition can be used for exercises in the 3rd edition that have not changed from the previous edition.
