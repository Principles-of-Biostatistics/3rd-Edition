# Principles of Biostatistics, 3rd Edition

Welcome to the Principles of Biostatistics 3rd edition companion repository!

This repository contains the datasets and Stata and R code used for the further applications examples for each chapter. There is a `Data` folder containing the datasets used throughout the book, a `Stata Code` folder containg a `do file (.do)` of Stata code used in each chapter, and a `R Code` folder containing an `R script (.R)` file of R code used in each chapter. Note there is no folder for chapters 3, 4, 5 as we did not use any code for these chapters.
