# Principles of Biostatistics, 3rd Edition

### Need 2 data folders - one for homework and one for further applications/chapter text (overall folders - not by chapter)
- Link datasets in README file for each chapter folder

Welcome to the Principles of Biostatistics 3rd edition companion repository!

This repository contains the datasets and Stata and R code used for the further applications examples for each chapter. Each folder contains a `Data` folder containing the datasets used in that chapter, a `Stata Code` folder containg a `do file` of Stata code used in that chapter, and a `R Code` folder containing an `RMarkdown` file of R code used in that chapter.
